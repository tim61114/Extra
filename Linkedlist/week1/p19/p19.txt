This problem is similar to the one we practiced during class, but the different
part is to actually remove the node instead of reading it. 

The fast node will travel for n steps starting from the head(which is index 1)

After the fast node is finished, we then let the slow node travel from the dummy
(which is index 0), and the fast node go to the end of the list, so we can have
the slow node stop at the node before the one we are deleting.

We use the dummy node at first to save the head when we need to actually remove
the head.
