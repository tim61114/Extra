This problem is to rotate the linked list to the right k times.

So we will traverse through the list to get the length then mod k 
(The reason we chose to find the length then mod instead of using double pointer
is because k can be up to 2 * 10 ^ 9 but the length of the list is in range of
[0, 500].

We will then link the end of the linked list to the head, so this list is now a
loop, then we will find the k-th element from the end so we can get the new head
and the new tail.
