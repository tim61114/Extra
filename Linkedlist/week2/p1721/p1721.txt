1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

Explanation: This is the intermediate problem of the last k node problem.
We can use a fast and a slow node to find the the last kth node, then use
another node to find the kth node, then swap the value and we are done.

There are no edge cases in this one since the list will be at least length 1.

I think dummy node is not actually needed in this problem but I took the easy way out.
