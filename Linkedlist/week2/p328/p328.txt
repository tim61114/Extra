328. Odd Even Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Explanation: We will use two dummys and two nodes to track the current node, and
the loop will exit if the current odd node is null or the current even node is
null. 

Lastly we will find the actual end of the odd list, since the last node could
end at null after the procedure. 
(I think this can be done in a better way though.)
