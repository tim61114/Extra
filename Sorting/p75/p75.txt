75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Explanation: Since there are only three possible values, we can scan the array and augment 1 to the value to an array of length 3, saving the number each color appeared.
Then output the number of times of how much color 0 has appeared, color 1 has appeared, and color 2 has appeared.
