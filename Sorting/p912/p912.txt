912. Sort an Array

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order.

Explanation: I used merge sort. (which is covered in class on Feb. 2)

Explanation on merge sort: 

Split the array from left to middle and from middle + 1 to right recurrsively.
The recurrsion ends when the left index => right index (which implies the length of the separated subarray is 1).
Then merge each subarray into a sorted array. The merge function compares two subarrays and put them back in sorted order.
Which is to compare the two heads of the subarray and put the smaller number into the merged array until finished.
